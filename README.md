## A minesweeper multiplayer game on rails 5, finally! (not really)

-A quick implementation of websockets with the new version of Ruby on Rails 5, using the new ActionCable.

-This uses HTML tables to play the game (who needs canvas anyway?).

-This require redis-server to be on, and of course the beta version (as of apr/2016) of Rails.
